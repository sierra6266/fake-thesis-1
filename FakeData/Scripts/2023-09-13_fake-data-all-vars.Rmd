## New idea: create data with all var names from appendix. Use BRFSS as a starting point. 

For outcomes, create data using proportions in the sheet. Then, calculate a weight depending on maternal flu or vax in preg that makes the ai outcomes more likely if flu=1. Apply this to the outcome value and make it so that if the number is over 0.5 it becomes 1, otherwise no. 

This is to create data that is not totally balanced between the exposures.
